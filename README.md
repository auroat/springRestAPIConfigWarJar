# Spring Rest API Configurations for a War or a Jar [RPC (Remote Procedure Call)].

This Application can be deployed either as WAR or ran as a JAR file.
Thanks to SpringBootTomcatApplication it can work as a WAR.
Will be decided at the end as to how to provide the REST API, thus both configurations are present here.
